# Diagnose
It would be a good idea to rename the parent folder from clang-plugin to clang-static-analyzer
Besides the actual folder renaming some build files also need to be modified, in order to keep the integration with mach operational.

By doing this we state more clearly what that project does and how it can be used.

# Solution

Rename clang-plugin to clang-static-analyzer throughout the project

# Testing Plan

Two things should be checked after changes: 
 * The full test suite should still run and pass with no errors
 * There should be no remaining references to clang-plugin

# Implementation

I changed the names in the 95 files which contained these old references and tested as stated above. The changes can be seen here:

# A4 

I submitted a PR to the gecko-dev github repo for mozilla.
